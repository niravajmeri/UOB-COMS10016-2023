This is a brief tutorial on how to setup your personal Windows 10 64bit Home or Professional system to be ready for the COMS10016 unit. 
The below steps represent one out of many ways of setting up your Windows 10 system for the unit. Many of the steps can be shortened 
and they are outlined as is for clarity. Before you start make sure Windows 10 is up-to-date with respect to updates and features. 
It is your responsibility to keep your personal system and passwords safe.

<h2>CHECK SYSTEM COMPATIBILITY</h2>

<li>type "exit" and press enter to close the Linux terminal window</li>
</ul>

<h2>INSTALL THE VSCODE EDITOR</h2>
<ul>
<li>go to <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">https://code.visualstudio.com/</a>
<li>download and run the installer</li>
</ul>

<h2>INSTALL HASKELL AND QUICKCHECK</h2>
<ul>
<li>hold the Windows key down and simultaneously press "s" so that a search box appears</li>
<li>type "Ubuntu" in the searchbox</li>
<li>left-click on "Ubuntu" in the results and a Linux terminal window will open</li>
<li>type "curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh", then press enter and the update process will begin</li><hr/>
<li>Note: you will be asked for your root password for sudo purposes (approx. 2 times)</li>
<li>Note: after the installation, you may need to add "~/.local/bin" to your PATH variable. You can do this with the following terminal command: "PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin"</li>
<li>Note: if you out of disk space, try deleting ".stack". This is a hidden file that you can see using "ls -a", and delete using "rm -fr .stack"</li>
<li>Note: if you have any further installation issues, try checking these <a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/faq/" target="_blank">FAQs</a>. The Teaching Assistants (TAs) will be there in the first lab to help you with this in the setup labs.</li>
<hr/>
<li>after a successful installation, you can run the Haskell GHCi interpreter by typing "stack ghci" in the terminal and pressing enter</li>
<li>after a successful installation, you can run the Haskell GHCi interpreter with the QuickCheck package by typing "stack ghci --package QuickCheck" in the terminal and pressing enter</li>
<li>after a successful installation, you can interpret Haskell files (such as a file "File.hs") by adding the file as a final argument to your stack command like "stack ghci --package QuickCheck File.hs" in the terminal and pressing enter</li>
<li>after a successful installation, you can compile Haskell files (such as a file "File.hs") by adding the file as a final argument to your stack command like "stack ghc --package QuickCheck File.hs" in the terminal and pressing enter</li>
<hr/>
<li>Note: once you verify that GHCi is running, you can use the :q command to exit it and go back to the command prompt.</li>
<hr/>
<b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> If the Haskell installation does not work for you then hold on and use the setup labs during week 1 to get help from a TA. 
Only if after asking TAs for help you have not been able to install Haskell successfully, then consider looking into more complicated <a href="haskellextra.html" target="_blank">alternatives</a>.
</ul>

At this point your system is ready for most of the COMS10016 unit and you are ready to start programming in C and Haskell. Further installations
are optional at the beginning of the unit. However, during the last part of the unit we will use graphics, and for this we will need the SDL2 graphics libraries 
and a Linux desktop environment...

<h2>INSTALL THE SDL2 DEVELOPMENT PACKAGE</h2>

<li>left-click on "Microsoft Edge" in the results and a browser window will open</li>
<li>type "sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/files/latest/download" in the browser bar, then press enter</li> 
<li>left-click on "Run" when asked so the download and setup starts</li>
<li>in case your windows administrator password is required provide it and press enter to confirm</li>
<li>the installation window will open, left-click on the "Next" button, then "Confirm" and finally "Close"</li>  
<li>the windows x-server should now be installed</li>
</ul>

<h2>INSTALL THE LXDE LINUX DESKTOP</h2>
<ul>
<li>hold the Windows key down and simultaneously press "s" so that a search box appears</li>
<li>type "Ubuntu" in the searchbox</li>

<li>after some significant installation time, once ready, the LXDE Linux desktop should be installed</li>
<li>type "exit" and press enter to close the Linux terminal window</li>
</ul>

<h2>RUNNING THE LINUX DESKTOP AND CHECKING SDL2</h2>
<ul>
<li>hold the Windows key down and simultaneously press "s" so that a search box appears</li>
<li>type "xlaunch" in the searchbox</li>
<li>left-click on "XLaunch" in the results and a display settings window will open</li>
<li>select "One large window" and left-click "Next"</li>
<li>select "Start no client" and left-click "Next"</li>
<li>make sure "Clipboard", "Primary Selection", and "Native opengl" are ticked, then left-click "Next"</li>
<li>left-click "Finish" and a black VcXsrv window will open</li>
<li>hold the Windows key down and simultaneously press "s" so that a search box appears</li>
<li>type "Ubuntu" in the searchbox</li>
<li>left-click on "Ubuntu" in the results and a Linux terminal window will open</li>
<li>type "export DISPLAY=:0" and press enter</li>
<li>type "export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1" and press enter</li>
<li>type "startlxde" and press enter</li>
<li>the Linux desktop should appear in the VcXsrv window</li>
<li>open a terminal on the Linux desktop by going to "System Tools" and selecting "LXTerminal"</li>
<li>download the program <a href="hellosdl.c" target="_blank">hellosdl.c</a> and copy it into a new folder</li>
<li>change directory to that new folder where the downloaded file is located (just as an example in the Ubuntu terminal you find your D:/ drive via "cd /mnt/d")
<li>avoid using the top directory of your C: drive since it is write-protected by the operating system
<li>compile the program in that folder, for instance via "clang -std=c11 -Wall hellosdl.c -lSDL2 -o hellosdl", where the 'l' (small L) in -lSDL2 stands for link</li>
<li>if this did not work and there was an error then try compilation via "clang -std=c11 -Wall hellosdl.c -I/usr/include/SDL2 -lSDL2 -o hellosdl", where the 'I' (capital i) in -I stands for include</li>
<li>run the program, for instance via "./hellosdl" - if you see a sky blue window appear then SDL2 is working properly</li>
<li>note that some parts of the SDL library unfortunately have memory leaks, which may be reported back to the terminal...you have to live with it</li>
</ul>
